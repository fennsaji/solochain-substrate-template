**Title: Implementing Genesis Block Rebasing in a Substrate-based Blockchain**

---

**Objective** Enable periodic rebasing of the blockchain to create a new genesis block with the latest state while pruning historical data, to reduce long-term storage and sync burden.

---

**1. Motivation**

- Over time, blockchains accumulate a large amount of data, much of which is no longer needed for current operation.
- Genesis rebasing provides a method for trimming history and refreshing the chain from a known state.
- Especially useful for identity-centric or mobile-first blockchains where storage and sync times must remain low.

---

**2. Rebasing Strategy Overview**

The rebasing mechanism includes three main steps:

1. **State Snapshot**: Capture the latest runtime state of the blockchain.
2. **Archive & Prune**: Store old blocks in an archive and clear historical data from the node.
3. **New Genesis Creation**: Generate a new `chainSpec` from the current state and re-launch the chain.

---

**3. Implementation Steps in Substrate**

### A. Capture Runtime State Snapshot

- Use the `state_export` Substrate CLI tool:

```bash
./target/release/node-template export-state --output new_genesis_state.bin
```

- Alternatively, create a custom RPC or off-chain worker that exports runtime state periodically.

### B. Archive Existing Blocks

- Use block archive tools or snapshot tools to export full historical chain data.
- Push archived data to IPFS, cloud storage, or decentralized backup.

### C. Create New ChainSpec with Exported State

- Convert snapshot to a new raw chainspec:

```bash
./target/release/node-template build-spec --chain new-genesis.json --raw > rebased-spec.json
```

- Replace `genesis.runtime` section with exported state from Step A.
- Reinitialize chain with `--chain rebased-spec.json`

### D. Coordination via Governance or Scheduled Proposal

- Use `pallet-scheduler` to trigger rebasing proposals.
- Integrate with `pallet-democracy` or `pallet-collective` for governance.
- Upon approval, nodes switch to new spec at predetermined block height.

---

**4. Optional Enhancements**

- **Partial State Pruning**: Only remove oldest blocks, retain recent N blocks.
- **Rolling Snapshots**: Maintain multiple snapshot versions with progressive backups.
- **Validator Participation**: Require validators to sign the rebased state to prove continuity.
- **Version Anchoring**: Log version history and rebase metadata in-chain.

---

**5. Security Considerations**

- Ensure cryptographic continuity of validator set and state root.
- Validate state integrity through Merkle proofs.
- Notify all nodes and stakeholders before switching chain.

---

**6. Challenges**

- Network-wide coordination and consensus on rebase timing.
- Downtime during re-launch unless rolling upgrades are supported.
- Client-side updates may be required (e.g., for wallets and light clients).

---

**Conclusion** Genesis rebasing in Substrate provides a practical approach to blockchain sustainability. With the right tooling, governance integration, and archival systems, a periodic rebase cycle can keep a decentralized network performant and scalableâ€”especially in identity-heavy or mobile-first systems like MetaMUI.
